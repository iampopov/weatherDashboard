## Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather outlook for multiple cities. 

## Application framework

```
As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Technology

* Used the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

* Used AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

* The app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* Includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.
